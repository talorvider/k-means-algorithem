## k-means-algorithem:<br />
Implementation of the k-means algorithm for image compression.<br />
The algorithm is implemented on the pixels of the image, and then each pixel is replaced by its centroid.<br />
In order to run the algorithem, write the following line:<br />
python ./kmeanAlgo.py image_path ccentroid_init_path output_log_fname<br />
the output_log_fname include log of centroids in every iteration<br />
<br />
